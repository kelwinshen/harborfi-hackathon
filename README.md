##  Why We Built This

We built HarborFi to prove that **DeFi can power real payments** — for real people.

HarborFi is more than a dApp. It’s a **cash-in / cash-out layer** for Southeast Asia, enabling borderless finance with familiar tools and seamless UX.

With funding or prize support, we aim to scale this from prototype to production and onboard thousands of underserved users.
